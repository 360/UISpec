Installation

Download the latest version of the Framework distribution and unzip to a directory on your system, such as

    ~/Dev

This will create a folder like this

    ~/Dev/UISpec_X_Y

Where X_Y is the framework version number.

Inside you will find

    * The API documentation: doc/html/index.html
    * The source code: src/
    * The static library for use with iphone XCode projects: bin/UISpec/UISpec_X_Y.a
    * The header files for use with the static library in your iphone XCode projects: bin/UISpec/headers


To add the PureMVC static library and headers to your XCode project:

From the Groups & Files pane, right click on the Frameworks (if it exists) folder or the Link Binary With Libraries folder and select

    Add -> Existing Files...

Browse and Add

    ~/Dev/UISpec_X_Y/bin/UISpec/UISpec_X_Y.a
    
For each target you added it too, you should see the static library (.a) listed in the Link Binary With Libraries folder

From the Groups & Files pane, double click the respective target or right click and select, Get Info, and then click on the Build tab.

Under the setting, Header Search Paths, add "~/Dev/UISpec_X_Y/bin/UISpec/headers"


Note: The static library has been compiled for the both the simulator and the device.
